# Rule: After file operations that create/modify files, run 'ls' to check. After commands that display content, continue with next file operation.
# Boolean condition: Contains(command, "touch") OR Contains(command, "echo") OR Contains(command, "rm") OR Contains(command, "cp") -> next command is "ls"
