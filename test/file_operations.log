# Rule: After creating or modifying files (mkdir, touch, echo >), check with ls. After changing directories, list contents with ls.
# Boolean condition: Contains(command, "mkdir") OR Contains(command, "touch") OR Contains(command, "echo") OR Contains(command, "cd") -> "ls"

user: mkdir project
user: ls
user: cd project
